- 👋 Hi, I’m @ozozx
- 👀 I’m interested in redesigning things that already exist to a style I like, and making somewhat redundant quality of life programs for easier gaming management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack development, lua, glsl and hopefully c/c++/c# based gamedev when I finally get to it..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, can't complain on how things are made if you make em yourself
- 📫 If you can reach me on github, feel free. otherwise don't.
